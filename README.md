# DECdoc - Database for DEC Hardware, Software, and Manuals

I'm a devoted collector of DEC components. Over time I lost the overview over my DEC items, so I decided to model and create a database for my DEC collection.

The DECdoc database is not only suitable for items in my collection, but for all stuff DEC ever made (at least I hope so), and even more.

For details of DECdoc see file "Intro to the DECdoc Database".

For details of DECdoc database design see file "DECdoc Database Design".


Cheers, Ulli
