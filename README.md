# DECdoc - Database for DEC Hardware, Software, and Manuals

I'm a devoted collector of DEC components. Over time I lost the overview over my DEC items, so I decided to model and create a database for my DEC collection.

The DECdoc database is not only suitable for items in my collection, but for all stuff DEC ever made (at least I hope so).

For details of DECdoc see file "Intro to the DECdoc Database" (coming soon).

To make the DECdoc database really useful it would need a decent GUI. Unfortunately I'm not good at programming although I'm reasonable skilled at databases. 

So I'm looking for volunteers to make a GUI for DECdoc, anyone out there?

I assume there are two possible ways to go (not excluding each other):
- A single user version (probably based on an SQLite database) as a Windows/Linux program or as an mobile app (or both).
- A web-based multi user version (using the current PostgreSQL database)

Other proposals are welocome, of course!

I had an attempt using "Kivy" for platform independance, but my knowledge of Python didn't suffice.

If there's a volunteer for the single user GUI I would work on the DECdoc database port to SQLite.

Cheers, Ulli
