# WANTED

- I'm looking for volunteers to program a GUI for the DECdoc database
- Does anyone know a free tool to model databases which has got the ability to work with several seperate (but logically connected) "Views" ? 
I need it to manage my database model - it's virtually impossible to manage 80+ heavily interconnected tables in one view. I must admit I'd prefer a Linux based one ...
- Anyone crazy enough out there to try to port the DECdoc database to DSM (Digital Standard MUMPS) or another MUMPS dialect?
- Ambitious DEC RDB connoisseurs to port the DECdoc database to DECs own database system?
